Welcome to our newest, most innovative trading platform. We are a team of experienced traders and developers who have come together to create a platform that is both easy to use and powerful. Our platform is built on the latest technology and is designed to be fast (extremely fast), secure, and reliable.

You, as a trader can submit trading strategies to our engine. The strategy is basically a mathematical expression that decides whether the strategy buys (positive returns) or sells stock (negative returns). The engine will then run the strategy on the stock market and return the results to you. And that's basically it! You are a millionaire now!

Our strategies can be as simple or as complex as you like. We provide the tools, and you provide the creativity.

In the strategy body you can use the following operators: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')', '!', '^'. In addition we provide some built-in variables that you can use in your strategy. These are:

1. `BALANCE` - Returns the current balance.
2. `STOCK_PRICE` - Returns the current stock price.
3. `HOLDINGS` - Returns the number of stocks the user has.
4. `HOLDINGS_VALUE` - Returns the value of the stocks the user has.
